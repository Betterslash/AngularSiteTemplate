   Hi there
   <div class = "info-container">
      Eventually all articles should have a short description:
      by directly using this template, in which case the short description will be unique to the article
      transcluded in another template, such as a disambiguation template, where a generic short description is adequate for a large class of pages
      where the short description is assembled from data in an infobox
      Automatically generated descriptions within templates should set the second parameter as noreplace so they do not override any short descriptions specifically added to the transcluding article.
      Short descriptions are not required in other namespaces, but in some cases may be useful.
